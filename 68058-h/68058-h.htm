<p>Among the mountain fastnesses the snow lay fifteen inches deep in
the open, a thing without precedent in the memory of the oldest hunter
in the Humpback region. The cowled peaks uplifted themselves,
wanly, and lay against a hard distance in mysterious, alien solitude.</p>

<p>In the midst rose Humpback, his indented crest losing outline for
days together by reason of the snow clouds that coifed it. In the
hollows, where many of the mountaineers lived, the snow was much
deeper, wind-drifted in swaths, fit to bury a man to the middle. Many
of the trails were blocked and, when the wind changed and a slight
thaw set in, followed by a freeze, the snow packed and crusted, which
made travel bad for people who had never even heard of snow-shoes.
The wild creatures suffered most, and whole covies of game birds perished
in the drifts from cold or starvation. On the other hand, minks,
otters, foxes, and nature’s other carnivorous children fattened apace,
slipping about the white frozen world, like demons of the inner circle,
and feasting upon the bodies of the dead.</p>

<p>As the cold increased, big game was driven from inaccessible
haunts and wandered afield in search of food, even venturing, by
night, close to the cabins and fodder-stacks of the people. Deer trails
grew plentiful, and the big cushioned track of bear could be seen in
many of the hollows.</p>

<p>When the cold first swooped upon them, the people curled up like
touched caterpillars, and devoted every energy not frost-bitten to
keeping themselves warm. Their cabins were built on hygienic principles,
and the very earth beneath them was unaccustomed to the rigor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
of a hard chill. After a week of it, finding themselves still living, the
men began to take interest and a hunting epidemic broke out and spread.</p>

<p>Dan Rice, the owner of good hunting dogs, became the most
popular man in the neighborhood and had his vanity so tickled that he
decided to give a party, just to show the folks what a fellow he was
and what a figure he could make when he set his mind to it. He had
a big buck swung up by its heels in his smoke-house, and nearly two
flour barrels full of small game, besides the intimate friendship of a
distiller of “moonshine,” so that he felt himself in a position to invite
his friends to make merry with him and “damn the expense.”</p>

<p>“’Twill thaw we-all up, an’ start the sap runnin’,” he explained
to his wife. “Thar’s plenty to do with, so you an’ the gals buckle on
an’ don’t have no sparin’ an’ pinchin’. This here shindig have got to
make a record.”</p>

<p>Word of the extent and elegance of the preparations went around
with the invitations, and also that Mrs. Rice and her daughters would
appear in new calicos made specially for the occasion. Immediately
every female invited felt life unendurable without similar decoration, and
domestic atmosphere grew fevered with discussions of patterns and styles.</p>

<p>Tom Westley’s pretty little near-sighted wife secured the sweetest
thing in rosebuds on a dark red ground, and stitched away at it energetically.
Her baby was nearly three months old now and her interest
in the outside world was returning. The grooves of her life were
well defined and narrow, so that any extraneous happening became an
event charged with unbalancing excitement.</p>

<p>There was to be a big deer hunt with Rice’s hounds, as a preliminary
to the ball, and every able-bodied man about the district expected
to take part in it. Westley proposed to his wife to go over to the
Rice’s early in the day and let him join her there after the hunt, but
got flouted. Mrs. Rice would be run off her legs with the preparations,
her considerate little neighbor declared, and would be justified
in regarding premature arrivals with disgust. She—Susan Westley—was
a housekeeper herself and knew about these things. Besides, her
own dress was unfinished, and she had a making of soap in the lye
which must be attended to. Then it was arranged that Tom should
meet her at a specified fence corner, a quarter of a mile from their
house, just before, or on the edge of dark. The way to the fence was
through a cleared field and perfectly open. She knew it as well as
she did her own door yard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t git so fired up huntin’ that you forgit me,” she admonished,
as she gave her husband his breakfast on the important morning.
“It’s a mile over to Rice’s an’ woods nigh all the way. The
moon won’t be up, time I want to start n’other, so I’d be feared. Aim
to be at the fence fust, will you?”</p>

<p>“All right,” Tom acquiesced easily. “I’ll be thar sure as
shootin’, so thar aint no call to fluster. Don’t keep me waitin’ no
longer ’n you can help for it’s tarnation cold loafin’. Wrop the
youngster up tight, or he’ll freeze. He ain’t none too fleshy.”</p>

<p>He had the child on his knee and was feeding it with scraps of his
own breakfast, calmly confident that as the boy is father to the man
that which is good for him at one point of his development must be
beneficial all along the line. The baby was chipper and healthy, but
exceedingly small, a fact used to shame his parents by the possessors of
more stalwart off-spring.</p>

<p>Breakfast despatched, Westley handed the child to his wife, and
invested himself with a shaggy overcoat and coon-skin cap, made with
ear-tabs and a droll peak in front which stuck out keenly.</p>

<p>“You want to keep out ’n the bushes,” laughed his wife, as she
opened the door for him, “or somebody ’ll be shootin’ you for a b’ar.
That thar peak an’ your nose, comin’ together, makes a mighty good
snout an’ all the balance looks shaggy. Folks can’t hardly tell no
dif’ence, fust look.”</p>

<p>Westley tweaked his cap further forward. “Ev’rybody aint short-ranged
like you,” he responded. “Thar’s a chance o’ ’em down out’n
the mountains folks say but I aint seed none. Wish I could.
’Twould be somethin’ to brag about to kill a bustin’ big b’ar. Far’well,
honey, take keer o’ yo’se’f, an’ don’t keep me loafin’ out yonder
’till ’tother fellows git the fust shot off Dan’s vittles.”</p>

<p>Left alone, the little woman worked busily, trying to crowd into
the short daylight hours as much as they would hold. Her soap making
required more time than she had allowed for so that twilight had
deepened to night-fall before she had everything arranged to her mind
and herself and the child made ready for the expedition.</p>

<p>The snow clouds had disappeared, leaving a thin, keen atmosphere
through which the starlight could penetrate. This, with the
snow-shimmer, made a pallid, mysterious lustre, exciting to the imagination,
but insufficient for guidance, except in places where the
way was open and familiar. The path across the field was a foot under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
cover, but a big sycamore grew near the trysting place by which it
could be identified. The accustomed aspect of the earth had vanished
and in its place was illusion and mystery.</p>

<p>Sue Westley hurried forward, hugging the cocoon which contained
her baby close to her breast. She crossed the field hap-hazard,
straining her near-sighted eyes for a glimpse of the sycamore, which
was her objective point. Ice-coated weeds uplifted themselves above
the snow crust on every side, and, when her skirts brushed against
them, the ice broke and fell off with a faint metallic tinkle. The
crunching of the snow under foot made her nervous, giving her the
feeling of being followed, and involuntarily she began to work herself
into a panic of fear that Tom would not meet her.</p>

<p>Her relief was proportionately great when, nearing the fence, she
dimly discerned something tall and bulky leaning against it. She
quickened her pace and became explanatory.</p>

<p>“I’m awful sorry I ke’p you waitin’, Tom, but I couldn’t git
through no quicker,” she said eagerly. “That thar soap done meaner
’en any truck ever biled. Look, to me, like jedgment day’d git here
afore it thimbled. That threw me late milkin’ an’ feedin’, an’ thar
was baby to dress an’ me too. You’re nigh frozen I reckon, but we-all
can walk rapid the balance o’ the way. Here, take the baby
whilst I unhook my dress. It’s caught on a scrop o’ bresh.”</p>

<p>Scarcely noticing, she rested the child on the top-rail, steadying
it there with one hand, while she bent down and freed her skirt. The
figure beside the fence made no answer, but reached forward and drew
the bundle from under her hand.</p>

<p>Sue turned to the next panel, which was unincumbered by brush,
and climbed it with the agility of a monkey. Tom had remembered,
and been before her at the tryst. A warm glow of satisfaction was
generated in her heart and sent her spirits up to mischief heat. She
sped forward, with a laugh, and then turned and began jumping backwards,
chattering like a black bird. Tom must carry the baby awhile,
she declared, her arms were tired, and besides she wanted to frolic.
Then she swooped sideways and tried to grab up a handful of snow,
but the hard crust defied her. No matter; snow balling Tom might
be fun, but there was the danger of hitting the baby. She steadied
herself and called out to him to hurry up and join her. She wanted
to hear about the hunt.</p>

<p>In the pause in her own volubility, made for reply, she suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
became conscious of an absolute silence, as of a vast void wherein
nothing moved, or breathed, except herself. She shivered, and her
spirits began to fall as rapidly as they had risen. Two explanations
of this singular silence, both equally obnoxious, swept into her mind.
Tom was trying to play a foolish practical joke; or else he had been
drinking too much and leaned on the fence drowsing and unable to move.</p>

<p>She started back at a keen run when the sound of a man’s whistle
cleft the stillness, arresting her steps and causing her to face about
uncertainly. Tom was crunching over the snow towards her, swinging
a lighted lantern and trilling like a mocking-bird.</p>

<p>Whatever shame he may have felt for his tardiness was effectually
routed by his wife’s wild demand for her child, and the sight of her
excitement when he, in his turn, inquired “what in thunder she meant?”</p>

<p>She threw up her hands with a cry that cut through him.</p>

<p>“You <i>were</i> thar!” she wailed. “Thar by the fence, just now,
waitin’ for me. I seed you. An’ you took the baby whilst I turned
myse’f loose from the bresh. Whar is he? If you’ve hid him in the
snow he’ll catch his death. Quit foolin’, Tom, an’ git him for me!
I’m skeered all to pieces anyhow, an’ can’t stan’ no such as that. Git
him for me!”</p>

<p>Bewildered to the verge of idiocy, Tom protested his innocence.
He had not seen the child since he left home that morning, and had no
thought of joking. He had only just gotten there. Luck had been
good, which made him late. Then he drew from her as connected an
account of the occurrence as her excitement would allow, and suggested
that, owing to the imperfect light and her own defective vision,
she might have mistaken a brush heap against the fence for a man and
laid the baby in it. They went back at once, Tom talking volubly
to conceal unreasoning anxiety, and Sue frankly terrified and moaning
just above her breath.</p>

<p>At the place where Sue had crossed, the snow-crust was shattered
in a large circle; they scarcely looked at it, one swing of the lantern,
low to the ground, being sufficient to identify the spot. Midway of
the adjoining panel the crust was broken also, but less heavily, and
Tom went on his knees and examined the marks with the experienced
eye of a hunter. There were faint but plainly perceptible scratches on
the snow, as though claws had scraped downward as the crust sagged
under weight. Tom examined the fence, holding the lantern close
and scanning the rails intently. On several he found hairs, caught<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
under splinters, and collected them until he had quite a number between
his forefinger and thumb. They were something over an inch
long, brown in color, and very fine and glossy—the hairs of an animal.
He laid them together in his palm, and held the light so that
his wife could see and realize the significance of the discovery. No
sound escaped either; they simply stared at each other, the face of the
father stiffening like stone, while that of the mother blanched to the
pallor of snow with the draining of blood from her heart.</p>

<p>The horrible truth seemed everywhere, in the earth, in the air,
and to shout itself through the spaces of the infinite.</p>

<p>Mistaking it for her husband, the woman had unwittingly given
her baby to a bear.</p>

<p>The man was the first to recover himself. His hunting experiences
had trained him to be prompt in emergency and ready in resource
at all times, but now, under this emotional stress, his brain
worked with astonishing quickness. Much time had already been
wasted, and every second was precious. The bear might still be at
hand, in one of the adjacent hollows. His lair was probably up among
the heights, but he might stop somewhere. Tom’s mind shied away
from thought of that which might cause delay, and harnessed itself to
action. He must follow the trail on the instant, going swiftly, with
crest lowered and light to the ground. He was unarmed except for a
hunting knife in his belt, but, in his then mood would not have hesitated
to attack a grizzly with naked hands.</p>

<p>The first step of course was to rid himself of his wife. She stood
as one dazed, her eyes fixed upon him, but unseeingly. She seemed
to be taking no notice, but he knew well enough that if he should
move she would follow him. What he wanted was to prevent her
from seeing, unprepared, that which he might find: to get her away
to some sheltered place where there were other women. Knowing instinctively
the value of domination to one in her condition he laid his
hand on her shoulder and ordered her as if she were a child.</p>

<p>“Listen, Sue,” he said peremptorily; “I’ve got to have help, an’
have it damned quick. You must run like a wild turkey over to Rice’s
an’ rouse up men an’ dogs an’ start ’em arter me. They kin ketch
up my trail from here. I’ve got to shove on at once. It’s the boy’s
best chance.”</p>

<p>Hope and life sprang like a flame to Sue’s face. “Air thar <i>any</i>
chance?” she demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, if you’ll help me,” Tom answered, feeling drearily confident
that he was lying, but keeping on all the same. “B’ars have
been knowed to play with babies, like cubs, an’ never hurt a ha’r o’
’em. Now, travel like lightenin’!”</p>

<p>Sue pressed herself close to him and held his lips with a brief kiss.
“If the child’s dead ye must kill me,” she muttered, and, before he
could answer, fled away from him through the night.</p>

<p>How she got over to Rice’s Sue Westley could never describe. In
her mind was a confused jumble of forest and hillside which seemed to
cut her off from everywhere, and of a sinuous trail to which she held
by instinct, catching her garments on the bushes as she ran, stumbling,
falling, cutting her hands and bruising her body against broken ice
and unexpected up-juttings of granite. Her sun-bonnet caught on a
low-hanging bough and was jerked from her head, but she sped on unheeding;
her abundant blond hair shook from its coil and lay along
her back like a half-twisted rope. At last she won free of the woods
and tumbled, rather than climbed, over the rail fence surrounding Rice’s
clearing, and raced in among the revellers with her face white as chalk
and her breath coming and going in gasps.</p>

<p>They could make nothing of her story, at first, until Rice, a man
gifted with common sense, got her into a chair and made her swallow
half a tumbler of hot whiskey toddy. As the liquor got in its work
her nerves steadied and she was able to make them understand the
situation and the necessity there was for haste. Comment and question
circulated like lightning and excitement rose to fever heat. Bears,
hunger-driven from the heights, were known to be rambling about, so
that the situation held grim possibilities. It seemed probable that this
very animal had had the Westley pig-pen for his objective point and
that he had just up-reared himself to climb the fence when the woman
appeared and thrust her baby under his nose. All thought of jollification
vanished like mist and every able-bodied man in the crowd
grabbed for his gun and whooped up the hounds.</p>

<p>Tom, meanwhile, followed the dents in the snow-crust, thankful
for his own forethought in providing himself with a lantern. The
moon would be up after a little, but in the urgent present the necessity
for light was overwhelming. The trail led him through a jungly hollow
and across a long ridge into another hollow. Here some clearing
for firewood had been made and the trees were scattered at long intervals,
with stumps and brush heaps between, transformed by a mantling
of snow into strange similitudes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>

<p>As he entered the place, Tom was conscious of a soft increase of
light and glancing backward beheld a three-quarter moon disengaging
herself from the tree-tops. In a few moments she had won clear and
was sailing upward into unobstructed space, from whence she cast
earthward rays which were refracted from millions of snow crystals.</p>

<p>Tom held to the trail like a blood-hound, but near the centre of
the clearing he was brought up all standing by the most singular spectacle
his eyes ever beheld. Not fifty yards ahead was the bear, erect
upon his hind legs and gyrating slowly in a circle as though keeping
time to imaginary music. As Tom looked, the beast bent downward
and cautiously executed a somersault, grunting with joy in his own
performance. Then he moved backward in a straight line, as though
to give himself headway, and suddenly bounced toward the pivotal
point of the circle, like a trap-ball, landing close beside a small dark
object plainly discernible upon the snow. This he caught in his
paws and rolled about softly, playing with it as a cat plays with a
kitten.</p>

<p>The wind, so far, had been in Tom’s favor, but, as the animal
frolicked, he veered about a bit and caught it full-tainted from the
hunter’s direction. He threw up his head uneasily and drew the scent
into his nostrils. Tom dashed forward at once, conscious that the
smallest delay would enable the bear to grab the baby and make off
with it. He whipped out his knife as he leapt and howled like a
Comanche, hoping to strike terror to the ursine soul. When he got
to close quarters he dealt the beast a crashing blow over the muzzle
with his lantern, and, in the momentary advantage so gained, contrived,
with a strong shove of his foot to send the baby skating along
the snow-crust to a considerable distance.</p>

<p>Then the enraged animal rose on his hind legs and gripped him.</p>

<p>Tom lunged with his knife, but failed to strike a vital part and
before he could draw out and strike a second time, the bear had a good
body grip and was squeezing. Fortunately for Tom the bear was only
medium sized, while he, himself, was a big man and a fine wrestler.
The breath was being hugged out of him, but his right arm was free
so that he was able to match science against brute strength. Thrusting
his forearm under his adversary’s chin nearly to the elbow he made
a lever of his own body and forced the head up and backward until, to
save his neck from dislocation, the bear was compelled to loosen his
grip and threw himself on his back, with Tom uppermost. In the fall,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
Tom freed his other arm and got hold of the hilt of his knife, which
he began to saw about in the wound furiously.</p>

<p>How the battle would have ended, had the combatants been left to
themselves, is an open question. It was still undecided when the
baying of hounds came over the ridge and Dan Rice’s pack swept into
the hollow in full cry and threw themselves, <i>en masse</i>, upon the
quarry.</p>

<p>After them came the hunters, traveling impetuously and in
bunches. They found Tom sitting on the bear’s carcass, with a small
bundle hugged to his breast and all the dogs squatting on their haunches
about him in a sympathetic semi-circle.</p>

<p>They bore home the bear and the baby in triumph and Sue Westley
had to stand some rough joking anent her mistake, which she
minded no more than the whistling of the wind. Why should she?
Was not the baby alive and crowing in her arms, and Tom the hero of
the hour because of his prowess? The fiddlers tuned up their instruments
and the women set about restoring to toothsomeness the belated
supper, so that, despite the interruption, the frolic came off hilariously
and fulfilled Dan’s ambition by making a record.</p>

<p>Two things alone blunted the edge of Tom’s satisfaction. One
was that a small iron ring was discovered in the bear’s muzzle, showing
that at one portion of his career it must have been accustomed to
human dominance. This probably accounted for its gentleness and
antics with the baby, but it also took the bloom off of boasting.</p>

<p>The other trouble was the publicity given the affair by the county
newspaper, which published the story in detail. This last, Tom regarded
narrow-mindedly, and denounced as an outrage.</p>

<p>“Its dog-goned impidence an’ meddlesomeness,” he fumed. “An’
if ’twarn’t for makin’ bad wuss, by givin’ him another tale to yelp
over, I’d b’ar-bait that thar outdacious varmint in his own hollow.
What sort o’ trick is it to play on a fellow, to set all the state o’ Virginny
grinning like a ’possum at him bekase his own wife didn’t have
enough gumption to know him from a b’ar?”</p>

<p>At which protest his neighbors howled with derision and unfeelingly
reminded him that when certain adventures of <i>theirs</i> had been
made public through the same medium he, Tom, had considered the
matter vastly amusing.</p>

<p>[Until he becomes an artistic star of the first magnitude (when he is apt to be
as rich and as arrogant as the fabled Indian Rajah,) the world is often exceedingly
ungenerous to the struggling young painter, however talented he may be. Even
Paris—usually so kind to budding genius—is sometimes guilty of this offense. The
following little narrative will prove the truth of my statement.]</p>

</div>

<p>Little Barlow was very poor indeed and, what was much more
serious, had stretched his limited credit just as far as it would go. He
didn’t like to do this at all, but there was no help for it and it grieved
him sorely. Therefore he became daily more despairing and sick at
heart as one by one his most promising schemes for money making
came to naught and the trades-people presented their bills with a
machine-like promptness and inevitability.</p>

<p>He possessed only one living relative in America, a millionaire
uncle—who was addicted to the pernicious habit of endowing memorial
hospitals and colleges in total oblivion of his duty towards his only
nephew. Little Barlow had timidly approached this uncle for help the
year before—when he was suffering almost as badly from a similarly
acute period of ill-chance—and had received three hundred dollars by
cable in return, but, when the American mail arrived a week afterward,
it brought with it such an unnecessarily brutal letter that he heartily
regretted that by paying his creditors nearly all the money he had
rendered himself powerless to send it flying back across the ocean,
accompanied by the very choicest anathemas in his vocabulary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p>The most exasperating feature of the letter was the offensive
position his uncle took in regard to his chosen work. He advised him
to give it up “as he did not seem to be a great success at it.” Success
meaning to him—as it does to so many other business men—solely and
uniquely the possession of the special faculty for making money.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/theman2.jpg" width="550" height="300" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“Yet,” said Little Barlow to his patient little wife, “I don’t think
I have been a total failure, and won’t admit yet awhile that—even from
his point of view—I am not a success.” “No dearest,” she joined in
indignantly, “we won’t admit that at all;” and then she added proudly,
“we will show him some day that you will be rich as well as famous,
and will prove to him that he might have acquired far more lasting
honor, at very much less expense, by giving you a few well-paid orders
now—and so helping you over some rough places in your career—than
he can ever gain with all his vain-glorious memorials put together.”</p>

<p>Little Barlow kissed his thanks on the lips of his loyal little wife
and resumed: “I imagine sometimes that the old gentleman means well
but doesn’t understand our case. He went into business as a boy, made
all his money himself, and considers struggling was good for him and
formed his character, so I suppose he honestly thinks that that is the
very best training for an artist also. He doesn’t comprehend that we
depend for our actual livelihood on the caprice of the public (and are
often undeservedly worried thereby) or that we cannot paint directly
for money, or that if we do so our work is tolerably certain not to sell.
You can add up a column of figures, or measure calico, or weigh out
sugar, or sweep a room, or do a lot of other useful things with the idea
of remuneration for your pains in view, but you cannot write a great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
poem, or compose a great piece of music, or paint a great picture—which
must be poetic and musical as well—with an eye solely bent on
the acquisition of the almighty dollar. I never in all my life painted
but one of those horrid affairs that we so suggestively call ‘pot boilers’
and that—heaven help me!—has been knocking around my studio
as a lesson ever since. There seems to be something in it that proclaims
it a monster to the least intelligent, something mean about it
which says money was the sole object of its being born at all.</p>

<p>“On the contrary, if you paint a subject because you find it beautiful,
or interesting, or because you love to do it, it is astonishing indeed if
you do not find somebody else who would ‘love’ to have it and be glad
to pay what he can afford for its possession.”</p>

<p>Little Barlow had followed this theory consistently and had very
little left in his studio to sell. He had found that a great many people
“loved” his pictures; the only trouble was that the ones who “loved”
and wanted them the most had very little to give in exchange for
them; and that after the expenses for frames, canvases, paints, rents,
taxes, models and commissions had been deducted, there was scarcely
anything remaining for the sweet young wife, the two wee children,
and little Barlow himself. Still he hoped for better things in the future
and worked on, as he had always done, with a great joy in his heart.</p>

<p>Little Barlow had had a hard life of it and had practically “made”
himself, but in spite of all the sordid shocks his artistic nature had
received in that process it still remained intact and valiant. He had
also had his share of successes as well, although they did not exactly
come within his uncle’s definition of the word. He had had two
drawings and a prize painting hung on
the walls of Julian’s, the title of “Premier”
in the admission examination at the Ecole
des Beaux Arts and an Honorable Mention
and a Third Class Medal at the old Salon.
When he received his “Mention” he was
so proud and confident of his powers that
he rashly rushed off and proposed to a
charming little girl art-student just as
poor and as ingenious as himself.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/theman3.jpg" width="250" height="300" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It was during his honey-moon—when
he was blissfully happy—that he produced
his medal picture, and then there came a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
halt in his affairs for lack of
money, and the bills and the
babies rolled in on him till they
had threatened to drown him
altogether, and in sheer desperation
he composed his little
plaint to his uncle which
brought him the saving three
hundred dollars and, a week
later, the awful letter that
made him red with shame for
months afterward.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/theman4.jpg" width="375" height="300" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In spite of all his resolves and struggles fate had been adverse to
him once more. He was in great difficulties, and the necessity of
facing an immediate danger was again upon him. It was of course
useless and entirely out of the question to write a second letter to the
uncle, whom he felt in his anger would willingly see them all slowly
die of starvation rather than help them further, provided, of course,
they could do so decently and quietly and not make any unpleasant
scandal about it.</p>

<p>“I shall not write to him again, whatever happens,” he said,
clinching his fists; and then he added, with an altogether ugly look on
his usually placid face, “if the worst comes to the worst and we have
to shoot ourselves, or otherwise go under, it will make a great deal of
unfavorable talk at home and that,” he continued, smiling grimly, “is
something he won’t like at all.”</p>

<p>Little Barlow had not been indulging in any such gloomy reflections
the month before; on the contrary he had not been so hopeful
and light hearted for a long time. He had paid his rent and a big color
bill (which threatened to become malignant) with the compensation he
had received for a remarkably living portrait of a rich and titled
Englishman. “If I receive two more orders of the kind I will be on
solid rock,” he triumphantly asserted to his beaming little wife, “and
there now seems every prospect that I’ll get them. Lord Richemont
was very much pleased with my work—as was his friend Sir Garnet
Walton—and they have practically promised me at least one more
order apiece. I will probably have to go to London soon to paint Lady
Richemont, and who knows what will come out of the connections I
may make there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<p>Poor little Barlow’s day dreams were short lived, for toward the
end of the following week—when he was just upon the point of starting—he
received a letter from his patron telling him that Lady Richemont
found his portrait wonderfully good and true and liked it immensely,
but that she would be unable to pose for him for some time on account
of a serious and sudden illness which had pulled her down in strength
and temporarily altered her face. Then the bread bill dropped in, and
little Barlow, wearing an exceedingly serious and abstracted air, settled
it with the money he had reserved for his ticket to England, and the
next day (out of an almost cloudless sky) fell an unkind and unexpected
thunderbolt, in the shape of a legal summons from his frame-maker
to pay one hundred and forty seven francs still due.</p>

<p>Now this was needlessly cruel on the frame-maker’s part, for little
Barlow had ordered from him—or recommended his friends to order—nearly
six thousand francs worth of work in the past five years. But
the frame-maker suddenly “saw red,” as they say in France, and was in
financial troubles in his turn, and decided to fall on poor little Barlow’s
back with the entire and somewhat massive machinery of the French law.</p>

<p>“This document,” said little Barlow, gazing with mingled awe
and curiosity at the officially stamped paper, “calls for our immediate
attention. We are coming dangerously near to the point of being
seized and sold out, and, if that were ever to take place, it would mean
a complete and definite end to us.” While he was reflecting what it
was best for him to do under the circumstances, the postman once again
passed by and handed
in another letter
from London which
when he had torn it
open and read it,
eased his mind
mightily. It informed
him that if he
would accept £20
instead of the catalogue
price of £30
for a last year Salon
picture—then exposed
at the Crystal
Palace—he could dispose of it immediately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>He was so delighted at this unexpected good fortune that he
caught his little wife by the waist—although she held a baby in each
arm at the time and was in danger of dropping and injuring them
seriously—and waltzed her round and round the studio. Then he told
her all about the good news, and sat down and wrote a reply agreeing
to let his picture go somewhat reluctantly (for the looks of the thing)
provided he was paid at once; after which he sallied out and walked
way over across town and deposited it himself in the main post office
of the rue du Louvre so that there would be a little less chance of its
going astray than by simply dropping it in a branch office letter-box in
the next street. Then he went home and patiently waited for the
response.</p>

<p>A whole week passed and it did not come and he was at length
forced by the actual necessities of life to borrow twenty francs from a
friend named Bolton. Toward the middle of the second week he got
another ten from an acquaintance named Sidney, but still the anxiously
looked for communication did not put in its appearance. Matters were
assuming a decidedly ominous aspect now—the frame-maker’s suit
having been decided against him by default—so he wrote a rather
peevish letter to the Secretary of the Exhibition which, after some
further delay, elicited a reply. In it he was told that the gentleman
who had wanted his picture had gone away for a short cruise on his
yacht and had neglected as yet to make known his ultimate intentions
in regard to it.</p>

<p>This note rendered little Barlow well-nigh desperate. What was
he to do? He remembered
a kind friend, a Dr. Galt,
who had offered to loan him
a little money once before
(and whom he knew had a
warm heart for all the
world), so he went over to
his office on the rue St. Honore
to ask him if he could
help him in his emergency,
but Fortune was once again
against him and he learned
with a sinking heart that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
the doctor had gone to Edinburg to attend a medical congress then
being held there and would not be back for at least two weeks.</p>

<p>Then he returned to his studio, much discouraged and cast down,
and told his brave but sad little wife about this last and crowning disappointment.</p>

<p>“It’s no use,” said little Barlow despairingly, “every thing is
against us and we are now certain of being sold out. The danger is
immediate and our furniture may be seized at any moment. If I had only
a little more time I think I should be able to get the money somewhere,
but the hundred and forty-seven francs—and the twenty-five extra
ones for costs—might just as well be so many thousands, for I’m as
powerless to raise them as though they were. All the fellows who are
likely to have any money to spare are out of town and I’ve borrowed
all I can from Bolton and Sidney.”</p>

<p>His wife knit her brow and reflected a moment; then she said
slowly but bravely, “I think I have found a way of paying the bill.
It’s an unpleasant way, but it’s the only one of which I know. We
have pawned practically all our silver and jewelry but <i>this</i>, and it’s
right that <i>it</i> should go now;” saying which, she resolutely drew off her
engagement ring—daintily set with small diamonds and pearls—and
held it out toward her husband. “I hoped, dear, when you put it on
my finger to have always kept it there, but it’s best under the present
circumstances that it should leave it.”</p>

<p>Little Barlow refused to take it, with tears in his eyes at the
sacrilege, but she smiled at him cheerily and continued gently. “It is
off now and the damage is done, so don’t be gloomy, sweetheart, but
take it like a good boy. We won’t have to leave it at the <i>Mont de Piete</i>
permanently, for you are sure of getting some more money one of these
days, and then we can redeem it, and I will have another association
with it and will value it all the more on that account.”</p>

<p>So little Barlow was at length prevailed upon to go with it to the
<i>Succursale</i> of the rue de Rennes, and borrowed the utmost which that
establishment would lend on it, which was only sixty francs.</p>

<p>“This partially solves the difficulty,” he said gloomily, on his
return, “but if we cannot raise a hundred and twelve francs more for
the rest of the bill and costs, we might just as well have nothing at all,
for the real good it will do us.”</p>

<p>“There is that Mrs. Harvey at the Hotel Continental,” suggested
his wife furtively; “she wrote to you last spring and asked you the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
price of the little Salon picture which you had already sold. You called
on her at the time and she seemed affable and well-meaning, so why
don’t you try her now?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that she’s in town, even,” little Barlow replied,
“but if she is, I’ve nothing left to sell her, and I don’t know how to
beg. If it were for anyone else, say Bolton or Sidney for instance, I
might try to do it, but for myself, or you, or the little ones—who
after all are part of me—I really couldn’t. I’m afraid I’ve too much
pride left even yet!”</p>

<p>“Well,” said his wife, “if that is the only objection, I can suggest
an ingenious course of action for you. An idea, which is nothing
short of brilliant, has just occurred to me. <i>Why don’t you ask her for
the money as though it were for some one else?</i> You can give her that
impression easily without telling an untruth. You can say that <i>you
know a man</i>—which you do, don’t you, you big goose?”—she rattled
on, laughing heartily—“<i>that you know a man who is in great trouble</i>—which
is again true, isn’t it? You can expatiate on the sad particulars
of his case just as much as ever you please, in fact the more you do so
the better. If this will save your pride and enable you to ask her for
the money, I don’t think, all things considered, the deceit is an unpardonable
one. We were given our wits by a kind Providence, and
there’s no law that I know of—either in Heaven or Earth—against our
using them on desperate occasions like this.”</p>

<p>Little Barlow, in spite of his sorry plight, joined his wife in a
burst of laughter on the conclusion of her monologue and rolled over
and over on the sofa in convulsions of irrepressible merriment.</p>

<p>“Yes,” continued his wife, laughing so that she could hardly
speak, “let’s save our pride and try to get out of our difficulty at the
same time. Mrs. Harvey thinks we are fairly well off, as we dress
well, have rather a swell looking studio and apartment, and appear
tolerably prosperous to the outside world, so she will never suspect she
is assisting you, whom, I am sure, however, she would much rather
help than a perfect stranger. However, to be doubly secure, we will
start a subscription book for the unhappy mortal, whose name you
must not disclose out of consideration for his sensitiveness, and I will
put my name down at the <i>very top of the list</i> for sixty francs. You
must also make Bolton and Sidney each write down their names and
the amounts they have loaned you as if they were contributions.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p>“You’re a genius,” said little Barlow admiringly, giving vent to
a fresh burst of laughter, “and I’ll take your advice. It’s too bad
we’re obliged to impose on the old lady’s credulity, but it won’t hurt
her seriously, and it will save us all from certain ruin; besides, we can
pay her back later when something lucky turns up.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, the next evening, little Barlow decked himself out
very carefully in his best suit, pinned a gardenia in the lapel of his
coat, and, looking exceedingly prosperous and handsome, called on Mrs.
Harvey at the hotel Continental. He was fortunate enough to find
her at home, and alone. He chatted with her pleasantly on all sorts
of subjects, and finally leading the conversation ’round with considerable
tact to the heart breaking case of THE MAN HE KNEW, surprised
himself at the success of his hypocrisy.</p>

<p>He told the old lady the most <i>navrante</i> details of his situation,
and so worked on her sympathies with the probabilities of the wife
and babies becoming homeless, that she positively shed tears, and felt
in her pocket for her purse; and when—judging the moment to be
opportune—he showed her the subscription book, she tremulously
wrote her name down for one hundred francs and paid him the money
then and there.</p>

<p>He felt rather mean and uncomfortable in taking it, but it meant
life and hope to him again, so he thanked her fervently for the MAN
HE KNEW and, promising to give her news of him in the near future,
somewhat abruptly took his departure.</p>

<p>His little wife was overjoyed at the success of her scheme; but
they still lacked twelve francs. This sum they finally raised by pawning
a silver belt-buckle, two broken scarf pins, and their four remaining
coffee spoons, and little Barlow was able to pay the horrid frame-maker
in full and tell him what he thought of him in perfect safety.</p>

<p>A fortnight later he received a check for £20 from the gentleman
who had been off on the boating expedition, and about the same
time he got word from Sir Garnet Walton that he could paint his
portrait whenever he chose. So he returned Mrs. Harvey’s contribution,
with the heartfelt gratitude of the MAN HE KNEW, and
crossed the channel to a period of great triumph and prosperity. He
not only painted the portrait of Sir Garnet Walton, but that of his
mother, and his wife, and his little daughter, and several of his friends.</p>

<p>He is out of the gloomy woods of poverty at last, and his feet are
firmly planted on the high road which leads to fame and fortune.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
Furthermore he has learned to smile at his past misery and even to
forgive his short-sighted but benevolently inclined uncle for not alleviating
it.</p>

<p>“I suppose, considering the trying situation, it was not inexcusably
wicked to impose, as I did, on old Mrs. Harvey’s kindness,” he
remarked one day to his wife; “but all the same it was steering rather
too close to a confidence game to suit my conscience altogether.
I didn’t like the business at all, but there are unfortunately many things
in life which border on untruthfulness of action but which one is compelled
to do nevertheless. This happened to be one of them.”</p>

<p>“Who knocks at the portal—so late?” whispered the little Greek
maid.</p>

<p>“That may depend,” replied a clear voice outside, “some say I am
a friend, some a foe.”</p>

<p>The heart of the little Greek maid beat fast in her bosom. For
three nights she had heard this voice and for three nights a beautiful
youth, with silvery wings and his face concealed by a silver gauze,
had appeared to her in a dream.</p>

<p>“No, no, I have been forbidden to open the portal,” said the little
Greek maid.</p>

<p>“It is very cold and dark out here,” sighed the voice wistfully,
“open the portal but half way.”</p>

<p>“Only half way,” she replied, curiosity impelling her.</p>

<p>In this manner the beautiful youth, with silvery wings and his
face concealed by a silver gauze, affected an entrance.</p>

<p>“Oh, take the silver gauze from off thy face!” prayed the little
Greek maid.</p>

<p>“On a single condition,” answered the youth, “and that is, that I
may cover thy face with it. <i>In love, one, or the other, must always
wear a silver veil across the eyes.</i>”</p>

<p>So she suffered him to bind the fillet about her forehead, but still
she could not see him.</p>

<p>“Oh, take the silver gauze from off my face!” prayed the little
Greek maid.</p>

<p>“In that case, I will be compelled to leave thee and never come
again,” he answered sadly.</p>

<p>But still she plead with him, whereupon he removed the silver
gauze from off her eyes and for the space of a second she gazed
upon his countenance, which shone resplendent, like the sun in his
strength.</p>

<p>And she fell at his feet as one dead.</p>

<p>But when again she ventured to raise her face, he was gone!</p>

<p>The following conversation took place one evening upon one of
those points of Algeria where we Frenchmen have had to fight so
desperately and so often. We had encamped, or rather we had bivouacked,
in a charming little valley at the foot of a mountain, which,
picturesque as it was, suggested only evil things.</p>

<p>Our young General had gathered us together near his tent. He
had been giving us, with his habitual clearness, instructions for the
battle which was soon to begin, and which might require the greatest
effort both on the part of our men and of ourselves. It was planned
that we should start out quietly before daylight, noiselessly scale the
mountain, and force the enemy, at the point of the bayonet if possible,
with powder and shot if necessary, to cede to us the annoying position
which they occupied. Everything being arranged, and no one having
a desire to sleep, we naturally began to chat. The conversation turned
to reminiscences; not to recent memories, but recollections of childhood.
This will not astonish those who know what passes in the head
of a soldier on the eve of a battle. The words duty, conscience, fear
and courage were frequently uttered. Stories and anecdotes had been
told illustrating the varied and often contradictory ideas which these
words evoked, and we had begun to talk about our personal experiences.
The General, who had listened until then, contenting himself
by letting drop an occasional opportune word, being urged to tell us
something in his turn, began as follows:</p>

<p>“It is not enough, at the critical hour of one’s existence,” he
said, “to be firmly resolved to do one’s entire duty, it is necessary
above all to know where and what it is. If it is one of those doubtful
cases, embarrassing the intelligence of the full-grown man, how much
more difficult must it be for the unformed mind of a child. That
which agitates the spirit of a little one, at certain trying moments, is a
subject worthy the attention of older people, and it is my opinion that
one of the surest means of knowing the man is to study him in the
child. The child contains all the essential elements of the man.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
Though he is bounded by an infantile horizon his soul is none the less
a human one. Two things, although of very different nature, and
although they date back to the earliest years of my existence, have left
me the remembrance of greater perplexities than those which have assailed
my spirit at any other epoch of my life. Never has my soldier’s
conscience been submitted to more cruel tests than those to which I was
twice subjected as a little boy.</p>

<p>“Smoke some of my cigars, make yourselves some grog, and I will
tell you one of these episodes of my childhood. After which we must
try to get some sleep.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/tb1.jpg" width="225" height="25" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“I was a very little fellow, only six years old; it was not more
than two years since I had begun to wear trousers. My father, who
was captain of a ship at that time, being almost always on the sea, I
had been brought up by two women, my mother and my aunt—Aunt
Marie! I loved them equally. I had, in fact, two mothers. Although
they were sensible people, they both spoiled me.”</p>

<p>‘One can only spoil that which is bad,’ said Aunt Marie.</p>

<p>‘And Jacques is good,’ added my mother.</p>

<p>“It appears that at five years of age I was angelic. You see I
have changed,” said the general, interrupting his tale an instant, and
addressing himself to one of us who had smiled a little. “What do
you expect, my dear Robert, life does not leave intact all those whom
it touches.”</p>

<p>“Say rather, General,” replied the young officer who had been addressed—a
good fellow, although a little audacious at times—“if you
have changed, we know well that it is almost always to our advantage.”</p>

<p>The General shook his head and continued: “If I had never left
my two mothers, it is very probable that I should have been as gentle
as a girl. However this may be, and whether I was good or bad, between
these two charming women, I was the happiest little being in
creation, and curiously enough, I fully realized my happiness. My
aunt, who played more of a part than my mother in this story which I
am telling you, was a tall and remarkably beautiful person. My
mother alone equalled her in beauty, and that for a very simple reason—they
were twins, and resembled one another closely. Happily, their
costumes differed completely, and prevented me from making a mistake;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
my mother belonged to the world, and Aunt Marie did not.
Aunt Marie was the Superior of the Sisters of Charity of a large military
hospital in the town of —— where I was born. We
lived in this town during the long absences of my father. Mamma
and her sister, whom I often called “Aunt Sister Marie,” divided between
them my entire affection. It was indeed a great joy when my
mother took me to see Aunt Marie. Although this pleasure was to be
found only between the cold walls of a hospital, it was always greatly
desired, and awaited with the very greatest impatience on my part.</p>

<p>“To run in the vast, long court where the convalescents were accustomed
to walk, or to sit in the sunshine, to wander around that immense
garden, which was my Place du Carrousel and my Champs de
Mars, to be caught in passing, to be stopped in my wild flight, either
by one of the convalescent soldiers who were amused by my antics, or
by one of the sisters of Aunt Marie, or above all by Aunt Marie herself,
who, when seeing me too heated, left her room, which served her
also as a pharmacy, to come and quiet me and kiss me; to gallop over
the sandy grounds of this court, riding horse-back on a cane, or on the
crutch of an aged, infirm sister, who usually sat knitting on one of the
benches—all this was for me the joy of joys.</p>

<p>“The day of which I speak, a beautiful summer day, I had obtained
permission to play in my dear court for a whole hour. My
mother had to make a visit in the town, which would have been tiresome
for me. She had left me in charge of her sister and Aunt Marie,
from her open window, was not to lose sight of me for a moment. The
aged Sister Rose was asked to watch me as well, and then I had her
crutch, without which she was unable to walk. You see I was well
guarded.</p>

<p>“Aunt Marie, having mounted to her private room, saw from her
window that a door of the large building at the extremity of the court,
a double door, and one which I had always seen shut, was open. She
hailed one of the nurses and asked him to shut it; but from his answer
she probably judged that it was not possible, for it stayed open,
and Aunt Marie having called me to her, said: ‘You see that large
open door, at the end of the court, little Jacques?’ ‘Yes, Aunt
Marie.’ ‘Very well! It is the door of a large room, very dark and
very cold, where even big people are not permitted to enter. It is
written over the door that entrance is forbidden to the public! Promise
me, dear, not to go there.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>“I gave the promise with the intention of keeping it, but I had
not rendered due count of the fascinations of Sister Rose’s crutch.
Having jumped about a great deal, having pranced round and round
the timid Sister Rose, having thoughtlessly knocked against, and annoyed
in a thousand ways the soldiers who were playing at <i>drogue</i>, (a
game which always makes me laugh, as pieces of wood are placed on
the noses of the losers.) I was, as you may imagine, very much excited;
my horse ended by running away with me, and, instead of
stopping on the threshold of the forbidden door, which more than once
I had had the imprudence to approach too closely, he carried me irresistibly
to the extremity of the dark room, which I ought not to have
entered. I was going so rapidly that before I had time to think I arrived
with a shock against the wall at the farther end. I knocked myself
so severely that I raised a big bump upon my forehead, which
brought me effectually to my senses. My steed, Sister Rose’s crutch,
fatigued by the violence of our course, fell, out of breath, but not without
noise, at my feet. The silence of the room sent back from its four
corners the echo of the fall. Startled by this strange sound, I turned
around quickly. I was already impressed by the sense of my disobedience.
I had done wrong to come there.</p>

<p>“The sudden change from the light to the obscurity which surrounded
me, the cold chill of that room, following quickly the warm
atmosphere of the court which I had left all in sunshine, added to my
uneasiness, and the rest did not reassure me. A lugubrious row of
large white beds, all alike, enclosed by curtains of a most severe aspect,
which I had not seen in the rapidity of my entrance, occupied the
whole length of the room at my left. Not a breath came from behind
these curtains; the beds then were empty. I did not like to be alone
among these shadows. The blinds being shut, the daylight ended a
few steps from the door by which I had come into this redoubtable
place, and did not penetrate to my corner. For an instant I dared not
stir, and yet I well knew that I must leave this spot, forbidden to
grown persons, just as quickly as I could. Intimidated by my surroundings,
and above all by the obscurity and the silence, which are
not the friends of children, even the sound of my breathing frightened
me; I heard, not without fear, the rapid beatings of my heart. Forgetting
at once both Sister Rose and my horse, I resolved to reach the
door, and I walked instinctively on the tips of my toes so as to make
as little disturbance as possible. When I had taken about twenty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
steps, hesitating from time to time to regain my courage, seeing that
after all I approached the light, my presence of mind gradually came
back to me and I cast about one of those questioning regards of a child
who wishes, while he has the opportunity, to profit by the occasion
and explore the region into which he has unwittingly ventured.
I found myself particularly attracted toward a large black bench which
was placed along the wall to the left of the entrance, and which occupied
more space than a bed.</p>

<p>“Why was this bench, larger and a little lower than the benches
in the court, two-thirds covered by a white sheet? Was anything
hidden under this sheet? It certainly appeared so to me. While
asking myself these questions, I had already arrived three-quarters of
the way; a little more daylight reached me thereby. Light is a blessing
at any age, but for a child it is sometimes a remedy for all ills.
Less anxious as to what might happen to me in the room itself, I began
to be more uneasy in regard to what would pass when I had left
it. What would Aunt Marie think of my disobedience? Truly I was
in no great hurry to regain the court, and I said to myself that being
there, it would not cost me any more to learn why a white sheet covered
that big bench. In a few steps I drew still nearer to it. The
top of the bench was uneven. Without doubt something was hidden
there; but what? My curiosity carried me on, and without having
the least idea of what I was going to discover, with a bold movement
I lifted one entire end of the sheet.</p>

<p>“That which there appeared to my astonished eyes I shall never
forget. I see it even yet, as I speak to you, as plainly as when I was
six years old in the room of the hospital of ——. Yes, I see
it and I shall see it all my life.</p>

<p>“I saw death! a dead person! for the first time.</p>

<p>“Since then I have seen many dead people, more than I can
count; this one has rested in my memory more clearly than them all.</p>

<p>“That which I had uncovered was the head, white hair, nude
shoulders and chest of a man already old, whose immobility and extraordinary
pallor seemed inexpressibly terrible to me. I felt that I
stood before a great event. Nothing can give an idea of the stupor
which enveloped me. A hundred confusing questions surged in my
brain. Has a man from his earliest years an intuition as to what will
be the end of his life on earth? I firmly believe so. In any case I
was not deceived for a single moment by the thought that I beheld a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
sleeping man. I understood that it was not a simple sleep. One is
never so absent, so calm, when one only sleeps. But then what was it
that I saw? What was he doing on the bench—that impassible
being?</p>

<p>“‘Suppose I should call Aunt Marie?’ I said to myself; ‘Aunt
Marie, who knows everything, and can do everything? Suppose,
however, (but the simple thought seemed formidable to me)
I should touch him first!’ And, in contradiction to the idea which
I had that his sleep was not of that kind which could be disturbed. I
said to myself again: ‘Perhaps he will get up. Perhaps he does not
know that he is there.’</p>

<p>“I dared to place my hand on his shoulder. I drew it away
quickly. That sort of cold was frightful.</p>

<p>“A dreadful thought flashed through my brain. The very truth
of truths penetrated my inmost being. People must become like this
when they are no longer alive. But then—— I had touched a dead
man! I had thereby shown a disrespect toward him. I had troubled
that which ought never to be troubled!</p>

<p>“My heart ceased to beat.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/tb1.jpg" width="225" height="25" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“I imagined that I had done something irreparable. I tried to
find a name for my action, which I judged abominable. The idea of
sacrilege, one of those dreaded words of which a child does not comprehend
the meaning, came into my mind, and I said to myself: ‘That
is it, I have committed a sacrilege!’</p>

<p>“Terror took possession of me, and in my fright, instead of escaping
through the door which was now quite near me, I took refuge,
trembling, in the shadowy end of the room which had lately given me
so much trouble to leave. Perhaps I hoped to escape more surely in
the darkness from that vision, from that unexplained revelation of
death which had then for the first time greeted me.</p>

<p>“I stood again with my face pressed against the wall at the end of
the room prohibited to all, hardly breathing, without the power
to cry, and not daring to turn round. I fell on my knees and, with
a flood of tears, I demanded pardon of God for the great sin which I
had committed, and prayed Him to show me the means of effacing it.
Did God pardon me? I believe that he did, for I arose from my knees
having formed a resolution to repair the wrong which I had done.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
But it must be done immediately, and all alone. I had uncovered the
head of a dead man, and my duty was, first of all, to go and ask his
pardon, and, secondly, to render him peaceful by recovering him as
before.</p>

<p>“Such a resolution—the idea that he has a duty to accomplish—makes
a man of even a child, once he has decided to perform it.
I gathered together all my courage and started bravely enough. When
I arrived a few steps from the bench and saw that terribly calm visage,
with those marble lids closed forever, my heart failed me, and, taking
flight, I very soon found myself at the end of the room.</p>

<p>“But strength alone, not will, failed me. Three times I returned,
without being able to approach him closely—and yet, it was necessary
to do so! I invoked the memory of Aunt Marie, of my mother, who
would forgive me if I could repair my fault, of my father
who was said to be so brave, and I made an effort to start again, repeating
to myself when I was about to weaken, that the pardon of
others, of myself as well, and above all, that of the dead man whom
I had offended, could be obtained only at this price.</p>

<p>“I am astonished even now when I think of the amount of energy,
the superhuman efforts to surmount an insurmountable fear, paralyzing
him at each step, that was shown by the unhappy little boy that I then
was. I have been in many a trying situation in my career as a soldier,
but they have all been as nothing when compared to that one, which
preceded them by so many years. What was I saying? Feeling
myself ready to fail, with a supreme effort, I desperately finished my
course. I stood before the dead man and demanded his pardon, with
a voice which probably the dead alone could hear, because it resembled
a dying breath, and my hand at last succeeded in covering the awful
visage with the sheet which I thought necessary to his repose.</p>

<p>“That done, I arrived with a single bound in the middle of the
court; but I was at the end of my strength, and giving vent to a sharp
cry, I fell, deprived of all feeling, like a mortally wounded bird, at the
feet of poor Sister Rose.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/tb1.jpg" width="225" height="25" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“My fainting fit lasted, they say, about two hours. I recovered
consciousness in the arms of Aunt Marie, who had heard my cry of
distress. My mother had returned. On her knees before her sister
and me, she bathed my forehead and temples and made me inhale<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
something which burnt my nostrils a little but which smelt very good.
I burst into tears and my first word, when I was able to speak, was to
ask and re-ask pardon; and when I had to stop for want of breath, it
was only to cry again, ‘Pardon! Pardon!’ for that which was to me
an irredeemable fault.</p>

<p>“‘Pardon for what, my poor child?’ said my mother, when I had
completely recovered consciousness. ‘Is it because you went into the
big room?’ But Aunt Marie has already forgiven you. Do you not
see how she kisses you?’</p>

<p>“The kiss, yes, that was the pardon of Aunt Marie, but it was
not only of that which she knew that I needed forgiveness. All was
not yet known. I felt that I must make a complete confession, and,
in an account, broken by tears and sobs, I told ‘this all’ to Aunt Marie
and my mother. I told them all that it had cost me for having lacked
proper respect for the dead.</p>

<p>“My confession was not only complete, it was public; the surgeon
of the hospital and five or six soldiers were around us.</p>

<p>“‘Ah!’ said one of the latter, addressing the doctor, ‘the child
must have seen the old Marshal who was not able to recover from yesterday’s
amputation.’</p>

<p>“When I had finished my tale, when by kind words they had established
a relative calm in my conscience, when they had told me
many times that the dead man could never again be angry, especially
as I had asked his pardon, when Aunt Marie had made me understand
besides that although one should respect and honor the dead one should
not be afraid of them, a young sergeant who was there, and whom I
had teased oftener than the others because he most frequently wore the
piece of wood on his nose from losing at ‘drogue,’ asked permission of
my mother to kiss ‘that little one.’</p>

<p>“When he had availed himself of the permission, which my mother
willingly gave him, he said to her, as he placed me on his knee,
‘Madame, when one shows such courage as that at six years of age,
there is little danger of his becoming cowardly later on. That mite
will some day be a giant.’</p>

<p>“Whether I have become a giant or not,” said the general, relighting
his cigar,—“I cannot say, but that which I do know is that in
all my military experience I have never striven harder to be brave than
I did that day when I was brought face to face with death for the first
time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p>After listening to this story, we all of us realized that courage also
consists in overcoming fear.</p>

<p>The general was right. This history of a child was at bottom the
history of a man. It interested its hearers, and enabled each one of
them to make use of it as a lesson for himself. It was not at all a bad
preparation for the work of the following morning, which was likely to
demand of each of us a great deal more of perseverance, of resolution
and presence of mind, than of brilliancy and dash.</p>

<p>That we reserve for ourselves the compliment of the first <i>bouquet</i> we trust will
not be regarded as an impropriety. The necessity of making a formal bow on
entering for the first time the presence of the great Public is well recognized, and
in the performance of this duty, which holds for us a rare pleasure, a little well
meant selfishness is perhaps pardonable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dixie</span> is introduced to your notice as the result of the latest attempt to establish
a Southern magazine. Despite the precedents of failure that are ours, we believe
success to be possible for such a venture under existing conditions. It is difficult
to accept as truth what has been said so often of the Southern people, that they
are in general unappreciative of good literature and good art. That we do not concur
in the belief the appearance of <span class="smcap">Dixie</span> is conclusive evidence. We confidently
expect the most liberal support from the cultivated class of every state of the South,
believing a periodical of this order—a native production having at heart the interests
of the Southern people—will meet with an eager and a sincere welcome.</p>

<p>We have thought it best to make a modest beginning rather than to herald
our undertaking with a brilliant first number at the cost of strength that might
better be reserved for exigencies of the struggle yet to come. We have chosen to
build, and would have our success—if success await us—be the result of growth.
Having obtained the services of a number of the well known writers and artists of
the country, we are in the position to promise a continual improvement both in the
contents and the appearance of the magazine.</p>

<p>It was found necessary to make the first number somewhat local in tone, but
this is only a passing condition. We have secured for future issues contributions of
more general interest.</p>

<p>With this brief introductory note, <span class="smcap">Dixie</span> is offered to your consideration.</p>

<p>The presence of the Boston Symphony organization in Baltimore this fall was
thoroughly enjoyed, but it would not have been financially possible had not ten of
our wealthy and very liberal citizens formed a guarantee fund and contributed enough
money to insure the entire success of the venture. We have not yet seen any public
commendation of this very public spirited action, and therefore feel that it would not
be amiss to assure these gentlemen (whose names are withheld at their own request)
that the professional musicians as a class, and the real music-loving Baltimoreans
as well, are deeply appreciative and grateful for the signal liberality they have
shown and the example they have set for others to follow. Such things should not
be taken as a matter of course, or be passed over in complete silence.</p>

<p>Mr. George N. Mackenzie’s suggestion, made public in the <span class="smcap">Sun</span> of Dec. 13th,
of placing tablets on houses that have sheltered famous persons should commend
itself to all those interested in historical work or the improvement of the city.
Southern towns are particularly rich in this class of historic objects, as the result of
a pronounced reverence for old things and a reluctance to tear down and rebuild.
However strongly present methods of progress may demand the destruction of these
ancient piles, we cannot altogether condemn the unprogressiveness that leaves them
standing. They are a means of important instruction to the public; and their
presence in a town cannot but add to its attractiveness and prosperity, if attention
is properly directed to their existence. It may safely be said that the solidarity of
the English nation is in great part maintained by the constant inspiration afforded
by the innumerable monuments, of all kinds, that cover English soil. They are
material evidence of past greatness. Is there a more powerful agent than precedent?
We step from the past to the present, and in proportion to the firmness of
the position of the rear foot we advance. Preserve the monuments at any cost!
The houses of great men are as sacred as their graves; and it should be a shame to
that city that negligently or wilfully suffers them to be destroyed.</p>

<p>There is a very laudable scheme on foot just now to erect a monument, or
statue, to the memory of Maryland’s contingent of Confederate and Federal soldiers
who lost their lives on the battle-field of Antietam. The idea of such a memorial
does great credit to the magnanimity of the American people, and offers another
convincing proof to the world at large that we are again a truly united and broadminded
nation. The lofty patriotism that suggests and makes practicable the erection
of a monument of this description is beyond all praise and cannot be commended
too highly: There is, however,—if a recent experience teaches us anything—an
unfortunate element of danger that, no matter what noble-minded motives may
have originally inspired this projected tribute to our brave dead, its artistic side
may actually leave much to be desired; and that in the next century, when we shall
have at length become a truly artistic people, we may turn our heads aside and
blush for it, as we do now for the hideous Firemen’s Tablet and the Lord Baltimore
of Cathedral street.</p>

<p>There is no reason but ignorance for the existence of such a state of things.
Nothing is easier than to get expert judgment on those architectural and sculptural
plans that may be submitted to the committee in charge of the erection of
this monument. There is a very common, and most erroneous, idea that trained
technical and artistic knowledge is unnecessary in such cases, whereas no task is in
reality more difficult. To be able to choose correctly, from the many rough little
wax and clay suggestions huddled momentarily together, the project which will
produce, when it is thrown up on a large scale and carefully finished, the most
beautiful and inspiring work of art, requires an experience that is almost invariably
lacking in the persons so thoughtlessly given the power to say which theme
is to be adjudged the best.</p>

<p>In the recent case to which we have referred, a committee of laymen apparently
judged the sketches submitted to them solely from the point of view of
finish,—a most immaterial matter in a sketch, as every artist knows,—and consequently
one of our great national heroes, instead of being eternally honored as was
intended by many of his admirers, is compelled to rest under a mediocre pile of
stone and bronze that, while far from being as good as it ought to be, is
just good enough to insure its remaining where it is for many years to come. Is
this sort of thing fair to the art-loving people who contribute to the building of our
public monuments, or to posterity that must receive and preserve them, or to those
heroes themselves in whose memory and to whose glory we would like to erect
enduring proofs of our love and admiration?</p>

<p>The Theatrical Trust has at last met with a well merited rebuke for its peculiar
methods of business. The <span class="smcap">Baltimore News</span> took it in hand the other day and
told it some very plain truths. It seems that the local representative of the Trust
went to the <span class="smcap">News</span> office with a proposition to publish a half-page “ad” every Saturday
providing a local “ad-writer”, who thinks himself an authority on things theatrical,
was allowed to polish up the swell front advance notices. The <span class="smcap">News</span> not only declined
the proposition but exposed the whole affair. The Academy took its “ad”
out immediately, and published for a few days, “We do not advertise in the News.”
Foolish mistake! What is the use of flinging mud at a man who owns a mud-machine?</p>

<p>We heartily commend the <span class="smcap">News</span> for the action it has taken in this matter. It
is an outrage that a few men should attempt to control this business. They made
every effort to close the doors of the very popular Lyceum, and leave Mr. Albaugh
to starve if he saw fit, but the energy and perseverance of his son Jack were entirely
successful in defeating their purpose, and the good people of Baltimore have fully
shown their appreciation of his pluck. Now the Trust is measuring steel with the
Fords, but in spite of giving them the worst of it in the way of attractions, the
Fords are making more money than the Academy. Ford and Albaugh are the
names that represent everything theatrical in Baltimore. Years and years ago
these two men had firmly established themselves with Baltimoreans, and it will take
more than a theatrical trust to inspire hostility where there has always existed
confidence and good-will.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt as to the precarious condition of music in Baltimore at
the beginning of the year eighteen hundred and ninety-nine; but there
is much that can be done to improve its really sad plight. In other words, its state,
while deplorable in the extreme, is not altogether hopeless. It is deeply to be regretted
that the recent manager of the Peabody Institute, a man of great and acknowledged
musical ability, having had the chance to make Baltimore the recognized
musical centre of America, should have failed so utterly to add that distinction
to the metropolis of the South.</p>

<p>His successor, a young man of education, of refinement, and of apparent ambition,
although undoubtedly handicapped by the legacy of sterile contentions and
discouragements left him by his predecessor, has still a very brilliant opportunity
before him. Will he succeed ultimately where his master has so conspicuously
failed? We sincerely hope so, and trust that some few of our misgivings, arising
from what we fear is a tendency to cultivate the noisy and pretentious few at the expense
of the more modest, but by far the more musical, majority may prove after all
to be groundless.</p>

<p>Nothing so forcibly illustrates the inability of even educated persons to distinguish
between the good and the bad as the family portrait. How seldom one
sees in houses otherwise marked by refinement and good taste this really necessary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
and, to future generations, valuable object characterized by sufficient artistic merit
to insure to it one’s attention for five minutes. And how often it is a mere caricature
of the person whose portrayal has been attempted. What man dare call himself
educated who has not sufficiently acquainted himself with the elements of
drawing and color to know when he, or some member of his family, is being transferred
to canvas for no better purpose than to afford amusement for persons of
greater knowledge and judgment. It is true all of us cannot spare the time to acquire
even the elements of an art education, but then it is equally true that the upper
class of Americans is not truly a cultivated class, is not possessed of the culture of
the same class in Europe. This is lamentable; but sadder still is the knowledge
that the egotism (widely known as the American spirit) of the average man of refinement
will preclude for a long time to come a betterment of the situation.</p>

<p>Baltimore, among other cities noted for their educated class, has been, and still
is, an easy victim to the artist of the solar-print. Nothing more thoroughly delights
the heart of a Baltimorean of average development than to come into possession
of one of those family portraits that exhibit all the rotundity of objects
turned on a lathe, the burnish (in the high lights) of excessively polished metal-ware,
and the finish of a miniature done under the glass of a microscope. In such
work the ideal of portrait painting is reached—for the Baltimorean of average development.
The revered canvas is given the place of honor in the most prominent
room of the house and there left for the adoration of all who enter—no one daring
to call down upon his head, for adverse criticism, the pitying scorn of the deluded
family. “It is a speaking likeness rendered with unusual technical skill.” One
often wishes, as a relief for tortured eyes, that painters could do without technique
altogether, and might be allowed to indulge the wildest flights of imagination conceivable
in depicting the features of beloved relatives and friends.</p>

<p>But little can be said in defense of the “artist” who produces this class of
work. It is the result of either a base commercial spirit or of untalented affrontery
that trades on the ignorance of those who should blush for their little knowledge.
In many instances these painters have had every opportunity for study at home and
abroad, and yet seek to degrade a profession they can in no wise benefit. Have
the patrons of these men concluded that honesty has lost its worth, and that a bad
painter is more useful that a good photographer? An almost hopeless ignorance of
art is, in these cases, the true explanation of why this phase of brush-work has not
long since disappeared from among intelligent people. As long as men are found
willing to pay for a bad thing the parodists of art will continue to flourish. That it
is not the ignorant, or unscrupulous, painter who needs to be educated is easily
seen.</p>

<p>Baltimore, with its unusually large number of thinking people, is not altogether
hopeless of improvement in its ideas of art. Fortunately there are here a few families
that have true judgment in such matters, and whose influence, although at
present but little felt, has a tendency to create a future favorable to good work.
May that happy epoch not be synchronous with the Millennium.</p>

<h3>MR. JAMES TURNS THE SCREW.</h3>

<p>Mr. Henry James is perhaps the one anomaly of American art. True, we have
Howells at his heels, some people may say at his head, but Howells is by no means
an inexplicable product, and he is as far from being like James as James is far from
being the counterpart of Turgeneff, the master inspiration of them both. One may
not like Mr. James—and there are many who will simply not face his difficulties—but
one must concede that he is literature. He is indeed so emphatically literature
that he is not always life as well. It is not a little to say of an author on the
shady side of his prime that he still reserves for his public the quality of continual
surprise. Long ere this, one is minded to assert, judging on general principles,
Mr. James must have declared his reach. Such utterances are, however, always
contradicted by his latest book. And his latest books, especially in the last few
years, have been a succession of surprises—shocks would be a better word, it may
be—that uproot presumptions. “What Maizie Knew,” for example, was a glance
of Mr. James’ brilliancy from quite a new angle. It was such an extraordinary ray
of his art that it has not yet ceased to leave a green spot of bewilderment on the
vision of the critic. With the cry caused by “In a Cage” still in the air, comes his
very newest volume, “The Two Magics” (New York: The Macmillan Co.,)
as unprecedented a composition as any of his repertory. To say that “The
Turn of the Screw” dashes one with amazement is not to be in the least hyperbolic.
It does amaze—it simply takes one’s breath and keeps it until one has finished the
tale. One is amazed at the art, one is amazed at the substance—and one is amazed
at Mr. James himself, and that, perhaps, most of all. It is an incredible production
for a Bostonian, no matter though he be long acclimated to foreign heaths as in the
instances of the author. We know of no other case where Bostonian blood has
failed so signally to tell.</p>

<p>One is saved from the supreme shock, however, by one thing—the matter of
Maizie. Maizie in “What Maizie knew” was at least an intimation of the terrible
facts of Miles and Flora. These angelic visions of eight and ten are a twin-birth of
horror before which the hideous perspicacity of Maizie pales to insignificance.
They are veritable limbs of Satan not in any human forgivable sense, but astounding
monsters of precocious sinfulness that give one a positive chill to consider as
within the bounds of possibility. Their portrayal is a slaughter of the innocents
equal to that of Herod. One arraigns Mr. James’ inhumanity in thus stooping to
cast so cruel a stain on the character of childhood. Maizie was surely enough—much
more than enough.</p>

<p>Can the treatment of such abomination be within the pales of art? One is obliged
to admit that it can be, because Mr. James has demonstrated it—demonstrated it as
we hope it will not be demonstrated often. It has, however, required all the resources<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
of his skill. The marvel is that he never even falters—makes one false
stroke with his brush. As it stands, “The Turn of the Screw” is a masterpiece;
one fails to see how it could be improved. Its art gives the envelopment to the
subject that saves it superbly. It is the kind of envelopment one finds in the portraits
of Whistler, for instance, and that is perfect.</p>

<p>Far from blurting out the business he may have in hand, Mr. James can scarcely
be said, at least in these latter days of his art, to tell it at all. Most readers of
“What Maizie Knew” must have been struck in the perusal with the fact that never
once did the story for all its plotless volume state in cold type what the child really
did know. And yet that Maizie knew what she shouldn’t have known was as obvious
as though she had drawn naughty pictures on her slate. The reader knew
what Maizie knew by a more subtle means of intelligence—by a kind of telepathic
communication. The book was a supreme piece of insinuation. Perfectly proper,
indeed, as far as the print was concerned, but what scandal between the lines!
One finds oneself subject to this same sort of telepathic play in “The Turn of the
Screw.” It is all secretive enough—superficially. The nightmare of children’s
little obsessed souls is not dragged into the light of day, but the horror is there,
nevertheless, patent to the eye and palpable to the touch. Mr. James turns the
screw, indeed! To set down the details of the story would be to mar its subtle relation
of style and substance. It is for the reader to take or to leave, as he finds it
in Mr. James’ volume.</p>

<p>“Covering End,” the other tale, included under the title of “The Two Magics,”
is quite in Mr. James’ usual manner. The “magic” of this charming comedy is a
very white magic, being no more than the brisk spell exerted by the heroine—a
Daisy Miller of later growth—upon the hero, the owner of an old English “show”
country house. “It was magnificent and shabby, and the eyes of the dozen dark
old portraits seemed, in their eternal attention, to count the cracks in the pavement,
the rents in the seats of the chairs and the missing tones in the Flemish tapestry.”
We have again all the sentiment of “old things” as found in “The Spoils of Poynton.”
The story is the kind of comedy that would “scream” in the hands of
ordinary art. Mr. James’ material is, however, never so ill-bred. Mrs. Gracedew,
widow, “from Missouri Top,” bursts upon all this faded splendor and question of
mortgages with a perfect whirl of Americanism. Her conversation is a kind of
metal skirt-dancing—a perpetual flash of pink fleshings. She is everywhere in the
house at the same time—“an apparition, a presence requiring announcement and
explanation,” indeed. She covets the house, she covets “the good and faithful servant”—poor
Chivers, whom she calls “Rembrant van Rhyn, with three stars”; she
covets the mortgaged owner, Clement Yule. They are all “types.” Even Cora
Prodmore is a type—“the ‘awfully nice girl’ of all the English novels, the ‘simple
maiden in her flower’ of—who is it?—your great poet.” It is Daisy Miller with additional
assurance of widowhood. She “grabs” the whole situation with all the
prompt enterprise of Missouri Top. “I’m here,” she announces to “the lawful heir,”
“for an act of salvation—I’m here to avert a sacrifice!” That she will avert it the
reader never questions. It is all delightfully spirited and worthy of Mr. James. It is
quite as much a masterpiece of subtlety and finished style as “The Turn of the
Screw,” if not so new a note in conception. After the horror of this latter tale it is
more than a matter of refreshment—it has the virtue of salvation.</p>

<h3>A GERMAN MASTERPIECE.</h3>

<p>The interest of the Anglo-Saxon public in German fiction has always been languid
compared with the avidity with which it devours the works, good, bad and indifferent,
of French authors. Mrs. Wister, Clara Bell, and a few other translators,
suffice to supply the English-speaking market with all it demands in literature from
the land of Goethe and Schiller, while, on the other hand, hundreds can scarcely
fill the publishers’ orders for translations from the French. It may be that German
novels are too limited in their appeal—too intrinsically German and hearth-centered—too
largely lacking in that modern “finish” for which English authors so
frantically strive and French authors so frequently attain; too deficient in what we
are pleased to regard as the saving sense of “smartness.” German novels as a rule
have more soul than smartness, and that is almost unforgivable in an age when
genius like the reformed pirate is expected to do fancy work.</p>

<p>It is perhaps because of this characteristic “high seriousness,” to use a favorite
phrase of Matthew Arnold’s, of Hermann Sudermann’s pen that he has remained
so little known to us in spite of his rare force. He belongs to the brainy band of
modern novelists which can almost be told off on the fingers; of which in England
Geo. Meredith is the lone Pompey’s Pillar; Balzac, in France, the pyramid; and in
Russia Turgeneff, the sardonic sphinx. Sudermannn first reached our transatlantic
consciousness through the success of Duse’s portrayal of Magda in “Home”, a
tragedy full of fierce psychic value and human pathos.</p>

<p>In “Regina or The Sins of Fathers,” translated by Beatrice Marshall (London
and New York, John Lane) Sudermann has given us in the heroine a character of
such stuff as Magdas are made of—a Magda in the raw, a Magda unintellectualized.
The story treats of man’s honor and truth to himself as in “Home” the author treats
of woman’s. The main difference is that in “Regina,” Boleslav’s self-trust comes
too late for happiness. It is only as the story closes he echoes Arnold’s</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent10">“Ah! love, let us be true</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To one another—”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">in a burst of passionate insight; but the chance had passed, Regina’s lifeless,
blood-smeared body lay under the Cats’ Bridge, where her imbecile father had
hurled it. Her fate is not unlike Ophelia’s. She is piteously involved in the misfortunes
of a hero burdened with a performance as harsh as it was akin to that of
Hamlet’s. The novel is a virile work, deep-voiced, full of dramatic color and
agitating some vital moral questions. Acrid to the taste it is in many respects, but
absorbing throughout in its appeal.</p>

<p>Boleslav is pursued by the curse of his father’s treason with a good deal of that
grimness with which a hero of the Greek tragedies is harrowed by the Eumenides.
One lash of the furies’ whip provokes another until life seems a madness scarcely to
be borne. His friends and sweetheart forsake him; the false name under which he
enters the German Array fails to protect him from the ignominy of the paternal
crime; he is ostracised by the whole world. We find him as the story opens returning
to the ruined home of his ancestors, where lies the dead body of his traitor sire,
denied the last offices of the church. It is there he meets Regina, the mistress of
the deceased, a wild and beautiful peasant girl, to the portraiture of whom the story
owes its chief interest. Regina is a magnificent, unforgettable creature—one of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
those rich chords that nature but rarely strikes upon the harp of being; she reverberates
through one’s senses with a rough sweetness that represents a real experience.
Her mould is Homeric; she is a creation of primal days and primal passions.
To blame her is to quarrel with nature itself. Regina becomes the refuge of the
stricken man whose noble motive of life is to redeem his father’s name from shame,
to rebuild the homestead of his race, to face unmerited dishonor with manly dignity.</p>

<p>His heart still harbors the image of his early love, and for long he cannot overcome
the repugnance he feels for the sturdy pariah who with pathetic self-denial and
endurance becomes his slave in the maintenance of the dreary rat’s hole in the
ruined castle where the two live. His ideal of womanhood is the simpering Helene
who obeys her papa. It takes him a long time to realize that dangerous maxim of
Nietzche’s: “Passions become evil when they are held to be evil.” And Regina’s
passions are as clear-eyed as were the children of Eden before they picked the apple
of Original Sin. As he realizes the fact, the girl’s character gradually usurps his
soul. A powerful scene is where they struggle together—the master and the slave—for
domination; the man’s strength against the peasant’s Boadicean sinew. It is
like the contest of sex in the African jungle. There is no sense of masculine meanness
in the contest. One recognizes some deep inner justification in it: that this
fierce strife is the materialization of what is really heart warfare. It is a spiritual
imbroglio. In the midst of the contest, as they pant together defiantly, Boleslav
suddenly kisses the girl on the mouth; and a moment after he is fleeing from himself
into the snowy night. The scene is infinitely human. In it Sudermann bares
the strange mystery of the human heart as only genius can.</p>

<p>In spite of this flash of soul-knowledge of Boleslav’s, the pair do not become
lovers. The man’s self-restraint still worships at Helene’s shrine. He finds that
altar clay at last. In the agony of disillusion he lets his soul fly toward its true
magnet, but the fortunes of the two have reached a tragic pass. It is Regina’s dead
lips that fate now alone offers Boleslav. Under the charred rafters of his ancestral
home that the peasants had burned in their patriotic fury, clasping the girl’s cold
body, his mind shivers amidst the phantasmagoria of human existence. The
world’s conventions seem to shrivel like a consuming scroll. Nothing remains but
ashes and the conviction that Regina was “one of those perfect, developed individuals
such as nature created before a herding social system, with its paralyzing
ordinances, bungled her handiwork, when every youthful creature was allowed to
bloom, unhindered, into the fullness of its power, and to remain, in good and in evil,
part and parcel of the natural life.”</p>

<p>Sudermann does not set his seal to the sophistries that Boleslav’s despair formulates
in these gloomy moments as he scoops out the frozen ground nearby the pedestal
of a broken statue of Diana, as a resting place for his drowned Ophelia,—buried
“with pagan rites.” His point of view is that of the philosophic spectator of the
world’s strifes and follies, who sees in bold-browed convention its justifications, but
also its flaws, its misreadings of nature, its littleness, its lack of large mercifulness.
Over Regina, as over Margaret, the voice of higher reason pronounces the
verdict of exoneration, Boleslav in his struggles with fell destiny offers a strengthening
exemplar of manliness. He is portrayed by the author with a discriminating
realism that couples weakness with might in a human way which wins for the hero
our sympathy, as the character of Regina compels our admiration.</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

<div style='display:block; font-size:1.1em; margin:1em 0; font-weight:bold'>
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg&#8482; works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.&#8221;
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works.
    </div>
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
